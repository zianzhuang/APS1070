Often, practitioners will use a third data set, the test set (or hold-out set), to get a sense for how their best model performs on unseen, real-world data. In this scenario, you will tune your models to perform best on the validation set and then test their \"real-world\" performance on the unseen test set.\n","\n","Sometimes applications don't have enough data to do these splits meaningfully (e.g., the test data is only a few samples). In these cases, *cross-validation* is a useful technique (and, indeed, has become standard in machine learning practice). \n","\n","The general premise of \"k-folds\" cross validation is to first divide the entire dataset (grey) into a training set (green) and a test set (unseen data, blue). Then, we divide the training set into different folds and use these folds to form new sub-training and sub-test sets. We select the model configuration that performs the best on all of these.
